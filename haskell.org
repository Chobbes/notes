* Running haskell                                           :scripting:stack:

  If you want to run a file as a script, you can put this on top of your `hs` file

  #+begin_src haskell
    #!/usr/bin/env stack
    -- stack --resolver lts-9.13 --install-ghc runghc --package script-dependency
  #+end_src

  where ~script-dependency~ is any package you want to use in the script
  and of course you can change the `lts` as well
